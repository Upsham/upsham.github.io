                            This project was a team project (3 person team) completed in approximately 8 weeks during Fall 2010 for an ASIC design class. We were given the opportunity to choose any viable functionality (ASIC-appropriate) and design a chip that could be sent out for actual fabrication for in-class credit. My team chose to go for the big guns, and tackle a 3D GPU directly. This project was done in VHDL, and used simulation, layout and design-checking tools (like ModelSim and Quartus) provided by Purdue. The major constraints were being able to fit it inside a 3mm x 3mm area and having under 40 pins. We also had to deal with the mathematical aspects of the GPU and graphics on our own (the class provided no background on this, and was a generic chip design class).

                            A highly simplistic block diagram is given in Figure 1. We created all the blocks apart from the General Purpose Microprocessor, the idea being that our GPU could be used with any Microprocessor. We used Bresenham's algorithm (ported to hardware) for rasterization, an optimized matrix math block for efficient matrix multiplication and controller block to orchestrate everything. We also created our own RAM, and used buffers as appropriate. I was responsible for the mathematical aspects, the matrix multiplication and World Matrix and Coordinate buffers. The size constraint meant that we could not afford to use inbuilt VHDL dividers, and had to minimize the number of multipliers. Additionally, we needed decimals, but the general floating point math would take too much chip space. Thus, I instituted use of a fixed-point representation of decimal numbers and did the matrix multiplications in an efficient manner (re-using the same multipliers etc) which enabled us to meet our constraints.

Our team consisted of 3 electrical engineers and one computer engineer (ie me), so we chose to do a project that involved both hardware and software. Tradionally, ECE senior design projects that attempted aerial vehicles had not been succesful and we when we heard about this 'copter-jinx', we decided to tackle it. We built an unmanned aerial drone by taking the shell of a RC plane, fitting it with our own custom PCB (sponsered by Purdue ECE) powered by an Atmel AT32UC3A3256 microcontroller and writing base station code to control the UAV via an Xbox 360 controller. We also handled the communication between the base station and UAV (Xbee/Serial based). The microcontroller programming was done in embedded C using AVRStudio, while base station programming was done in C#.net to facilitate GUI programming. The UAV also had a live camera feed, and was equipped to take hi-res photos of the ground when required.

                        In this project, I was solely responsible for the base station programming, and was handling the programmatic aspects and logic design for the microcontroller as well (sensors and communications were not handled by me). As an example, while I was not responsible for hooking up the Xbee communications (baud rate etc), I did have to make sure that the communication was 'reliable', i.e. data packets were not lost. However, in the end, I did help with PCB routing and other aspects and it turned to be a real learning experience for me. From the base station end, I used C#.net in conjunction with socket libraries and the XNA game library to communicate with the UAV, send and recieve data (and make it human-readable) and tweaking sensitivity on the Xbox 360 controller to make the UAV actually fly-able. Additionally, to reduce microprocessor load and to increase responsiveness, my base station code would pre-calculate the flight data, and directly send the requisite hex values to the microcontroller to put into the registers. Below, you will find screenshots of the GUI showing general flight data (Figure 4), and a screenshot of the main PCB design (Figure 5), omitting the powerboard which was a separate design.

                        Since this was a relatively large project, listing everything done here is impossible. We had to do everything from safety and environment analysis to technical analysis and present/defend our work each week. Fortunately, we had a create a website to chronicle everything hosted on Purdue's servers, and our website can now be found at the <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/ece477/Webs/S12-Grp03/">Purdue archives</a> . It includes things like our presentations, and even our <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/ece477/Webs/S12-Grp03/nb/udawra.html">notebooks</a>, which list the work done per week. Note that that website is not optimized for mobile viewing, and that the notebooks have lost the ECE styling after being archived, but all the content is still there. Additionally, we created a <a href="uav/report.pdf">final report</a>, <a href="uav/usermanual.pdf">user's manual</a> and a <a href="uav/poster.ppt">poster</a> at the end. The code for project (both embedded and base station) can be found on <a href="https://github.com/Upsham/Eye-in-the-Sky">Github</a>. We also created a video for the final demonstration, I have embedded it below for your viewing pleasure!

                        Since this was a relatively large project, listing everything done here is impossible. We had to do everything from safety and environment analysis to technical analysis and present/defend our work each week. Fortunately, we had a create a website to chronicle everything hosted on Purdue's servers, and our website can now be found at the <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/ece477/Webs/S12-Grp03/">Purdue archives</a> . It includes things like our presentations, and even our <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/ece477/Webs/S12-Grp03/nb/udawra.html">notebooks</a>, which list the work done per week. Note that that website is not optimized for mobile viewing, and that the notebooks have lost the ECE styling after being archived, but all the content is still there. Additionally, we created a <a href="uav/report.pdf">final report</a>, <a href="uav/usermanual.pdf">user's manual</a> and a <a href="uav/poster.ppt">poster</a> at the end. The code for project (both embedded and base station) can be found on <a href="https://github.com/Upsham/Eye-in-the-Sky">Github</a>. We also created a video for the final demonstration, I have embedded it below for your viewing pleasure!
